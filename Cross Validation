## Fit the Tree Model using Training Data.
tree_model = tree(High~., training_data)
plot(tree_model)
text(tree_model, pretty =0)

## Check How The Model Is doing Using Test Data.

tree_pred = predict(tree_model,testing_data, type='class')
mean(tree_pred != testing_High)

##Cross Validation To Check  Where To Stop Pruning.

set.seed(3)
cv_tree = cv.tree(tree_model, FUN = prune.misclass)
names(cv_tree)
plot(cv_tree$size , cv_tree$dev, type = 'b')
