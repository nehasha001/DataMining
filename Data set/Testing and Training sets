##Appends Vector High to previous Carseat dataset and now  our dataset will be ready.(Overriding the previous carseat dataset)
Carseats = data.frame(Carseats , High)
 names(Carseats)

Carseats = Carseats[,-1]
 names(Carseats)
## Splitting data into testing and training sets using-
 set.seed(2)
 train = sample(1:nrow(Carseats),nrow(Carseats)/2)
 test= -train
 training_data = Carseats[train,]
 testing_data= Carseats[test,]
 testing_High =High[test]
